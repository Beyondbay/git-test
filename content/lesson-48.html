                <p><b>OPENING</b></p>
                <p><b>BIBLE PASSAGE: Numbers 11:4-7</b></p>
                <p><b>MEMORY VERSE: </b> "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before.'" Philippians 3:13</p>
                <p><b>LESSON INTRODUCTION: </b> After the children of Israel left Egypt, it is unfortunate that the spirit of "Egypt" did not leave them. Despite the miracles of deliverance and divine provisions, they still longed for the cucumbers and garlic they ate as slaves because "yesterday" was vivid in their memories. The same thing applies to some of us who refuse to let go of our past! In this lesson, we shall learn how to overcome the urge to cling to the past, embrace today, and look on the bright side of tomorrow?</p>

            Num 11:7  And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. </em></p>
