    <h2>TODAY’S LESSON</h2>
    <p><b>OPENING</b></p>
    <p><b>BIBLE PASSAGE:</b>1Samuel 7:7-10</p>
    <p><b>MEMORY VERSE: </b> <em>“And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.” 1Samuel 3:19</em></p>
    <p><b>LESSON INTRODUCTION: </b>Samuel, the 13th judge of Israel was born of Levitical parents 1Chronicles 6:16 25-28; <em>2Ch 6:16  Now, LORD God of Israel, keep the other promise you made to my father when you told him that there would always be one of his descendants ruling as king of Israel, provided that they carefully obeyed your Law just as he did.<br> 2Ch 6:25  listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to them and to their ancestors. <br>
    2Ch 6:26  "When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you, <br>
    2Ch 6:27  O LORD, listen to them in heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, the people of Israel, and teach them to do what is right. Then, O LORD, send rain on this land of yours, which you gave to your people as a permanent possession. <br>
    2Ch 6:28  "When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them,<br></em> 1Samuel 1:1. <em>1Sa 1:1  There was a man named Elkanah, from the tribe of Ephraim, who lived in the town of Ramah in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham and grandson of Elihu, and belonged to the family of Tohu, a part of the clan of Zuph.</em> The Date of his birth was around 1070 BC. His mother was Hannah, a noble and good woman, married to Elkanah. The meaning of the Hebrew word translated Samuel is ‘God heard’ 1Samuel 1:20. <em>1Sa 1:20  So it was that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, and explained, "I asked the LORD for him." </em> Being a Prophet and a Seer, he was the last and greatest of the Judges Of Israel, who were chosen by God to rule over the people, and to save them in time of war and oppression. </p>

    <h3>LESSON OUTLINE</h3>
    <p><b>LESSON OUTLINE 1: HIS CHARACTER AND ACHIEVEMENTS</b></p>
    <p><strong>THE CHARACTER CALLED SAMUEL:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Samuel was a good and obedient man from childhood 1Samuel 3:9-10. <em>1Sa 3:9  so he said to him, "Go back to bed; and if he calls you again, say, 'Speak, LORD, your servant is listening.' " So Samuel went back to bed.  1Sa 3:10  The LORD came and stood there, and called as he had before, "Samuel! Samuel!" Samuel answered, "Speak; your servant is listening." </em> </li>
        <li>He was committed to serving God under the tutelage of Eli the Priest 1Samuel 3:1a.<em>1Sa 3:1a In those days, when the boy Samuel was serving the LORD under the direction of Eli,</em></li>
        <li>He was available to hear from God at a time when the word and visions from the LORD had become rare 1Samuel 3:1-4 <em>1Sa 3:1  In those days, when the boy Samuel was serving the LORD under the direction of Eli, there were very few messages from the LORD, and visions from him were quite rare. <br>
        1Sa 3:2  One night Eli, who was now almost blind, was sleeping in his own room; <br>
        1Sa 3:3  Samuel was sleeping in the sanctuary, where the sacred Covenant Box was. Before dawn, while the lamp was still burning, <br>
        1Sa 3:4  the LORD called Samuel. He answered, "Yes, sir!" </em> </li>
        <li>He was bold to declare God’s counsel to the house of Israel when they abandoned God 1Samuel 7:3 <em>1Sa 7:3  Samuel said to the people of Israel, "If you are going to turn to the LORD with all your hearts, you must get rid of all the foreign gods and the images of the goddess Astarte. Dedicate yourselves completely to the LORD and worship only him, and he will rescue you from the power of the Philistines." </em> </li>
        <li>He preferred the theocratic system to the monarchy demanded by the Israelites, and he openly displayed his displeasure of this choice 1Samuel 8:4-6 <em>1Sa 8:4  Then all the leaders of Israel met together, went to Samuel in Ramah, <br>
        1Sa 8:5  and said to him, "Look, you are getting old and your sons don't follow your example. So then, appoint a king to rule over us, so that we will have a king, as other countries have." <br>
        1Sa 8:6  Samuel was displeased with their request for a king; so he prayed to the LORD, </em> </li>
        <li>He was known as an intercessor who hears from God 1Samuel 7:8-9; <em>1Sa 7:8  and said to Samuel, "Keep praying to the LORD our God to save us from the Philistines." <br>
        1Sa 7:9  Samuel killed a young lamb and burned it whole as a sacrifice to the LORD. Then he prayed to the LORD to help Israel, and the LORD answered his prayer. </em> Psalm 99:6-7 <em>Psa 99:6  Moses and Aaron were his priests, and Samuel was one who prayed to him; they called to the LORD, and he answered them. <br>
        Psa 99:7  He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they obeyed the laws and commands that he gave them. </em> </li>
        <li>He was a man well known for his integrity 1Samuel 12:1-4 <em>1Sa 12:1  Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, "I have done what you asked me to do. I have given you a king to rule you, <br>
        1Sa 12:2  and now you have him to lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are with you. I have been your leader from my youth until now. <br>
        1Sa 12:3  Here I am. If I have done anything wrong, accuse me now in the presence of the LORD and the king he has chosen. Have I taken anybody's cow or anybody's donkey? Have I cheated or oppressed anyone? Have I accepted a bribe from anyone? If I have done any of these things, I will pay back what I have taken." <br>
        1Sa 12:4  The people answered, "No, you have not cheated us or oppressed us; you have not taken anything from anyone."</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>HIS ACHIEVEMENTS: </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1050 BC, the Lord instructed Samuel to anoint Saul as king over Israel 1Samuel 9:15-17;10:1. <em>1Sa 9:15  Now on the previous day the LORD had told Samuel, <br>
        1Sa 9:16  "Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the tribe of Benjamin; anoint him as ruler of my people Israel, and he will rescue them from the Philistines. I have seen the suffering of my people and have heard their cries for help." <br>
        1Sa 9:17  When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I told you about. He will rule my people." <br>
        1Sa 10:1  Then Samuel took a jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head, kissed him, and said, "The LORD anoints you as ruler of his people Israel. You will rule his people and protect them from all their enemies. And this is the proof to you that the LORD has chosen you to be the ruler of his people: </em></li>
        <li>He defeated the Philistines and ended their forty-year oppression of Israel in 1030 BC 1Samuel 7:13. <em>1Sa 7:13  So the Philistines were defeated, and the LORD prevented them from invading Israel's territory as long as Samuel lived. </em></li>
        <li>Through this victory, the Israelites recovered their captured cities and had peace all the days of Samuel 1Samuel 7:14. <em>1Sa 7:14  All the cities which the Philistines had captured between Ekron and Gath were returned to Israel, and so Israel got back all its territory. And there was peace also between the Israelites and the Canaanites. </em></li>
        <li>God gave him the opportunity to also anoint David as king in place of Saul 1Samuel 15:28; 16:1,13. <em>1Sa 15:28  Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and given it to someone who is a better man than you. <br>
        1Sa 16:1  The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you go on grieving over Saul? I have rejected him as king of Israel. But now get some olive oil and go to Bethlehem, to a man named Jesse, because I have chosen one of his sons to be king." <br>
        1Sa 16:13  Samuel took the olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers. Immediately the spirit of the LORD took control of David and was with him from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah. </em></li>
        <li>The Lord did not let his words fail 1Samuel 3:19 <em>1Sa 3:19  As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him and made come true everything that Samuel said. </em></li>
        <li>Prophet Samuel died in Ramah in 1011 BC and the whole nation mourned the loss of their beloved leader 1Samuel 28:3. <em>1Sa 28:3  Now Samuel had died, and all the Israelites had mourned for him and had buried him in his hometown of Ramah. Saul had forced all the fortunetellers and mediums to leave Israel. </em></li>
    </ul>
        <p><b>CLASS ACTIVITY 1: </b>Class should discuss the probable reasons God did not punish Prophet Samuel for the sins of his sons like He Prophet Eli.</p>

        <p><strong>LESSON OUTLINE 2: LESSONS FROM HIS LIFE</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some of the thing’s believers can learn from the amazing life of Prophet Samuel:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The gift of Samuel to Hannah is a testimony to the fact that God knows the hearts of everyone, and His promises never fail 1Samuel 1:17-20 <em>1Sa 1:17  "Go in peace," Eli said, "and may the God of Israel give you what you have asked him for." 
            1Sa 1:18  "May you always think kindly of me," she replied. Then she went away, ate some food, and was no longer sad. 
            1Sa 1:19  The next morning Elkanah and his family got up early, and after worshiping the LORD, they went back home to Ramah. Elkanah had intercourse with his wife Hannah, and the LORD answered her prayer. 
            1Sa 1:20  So it was that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, and explained, "I asked the LORD for him." </em></li>
            <li>Samuel was a passionate, consistent, and faithful lover of God and His righteousness 1Samuel 3:20; 8:4-6. <em>1Sa 3:20  So all the people of Israel, from one end of the country to the other, knew that Samuel was indeed a prophet of the LORD. <br>1Sa 8:4  Then all the leaders of Israel met together, went to Samuel in Ramah, 
            1Sa 8:5  and said to him, "Look, you are getting old and your sons don't follow your example. So then, appoint a king to rule over us, so that we will have a king, as other countries have." 
            1Sa 8:6  Samuel was displeased with their request for a king; so he prayed to the LORD, </em></li>
            <li>God will always talk to His loved ones and reveal His secrets to them 1Samuel 3:11. <em>1Sa 3:11  The LORD said to him, "Some day I am going to do something to the people of Israel that is so terrible that everyone who hears about it will be stunned. </em></li>
            <li>Faithfulness to God commands authority and great respect from people 1Samuel 15:26-28; 16:4 <em>1Sa 15:26  "I will not go back with you," Samuel answered. "You rejected the LORD's command, and he has rejected you as king of Israel." 
            1Sa 15:27  Then Samuel turned to leave, but Saul caught hold of his cloak, and it tore. 
            1Sa 15:28  Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and given it to someone who is a better man than you. <br> 1Sa 16:4  Samuel did what the LORD told him to do and went to Bethlehem, where the city leaders came trembling to meet him and asked, "Is this a peaceful visit, seer?" </em></li>
            <li>We must choose to obey and honour God totally above men 1Samuel 15:24, 32-33 <em>1Sa 15:24  "Yes, I have sinned," Saul replied. "I disobeyed the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of my men and did what they wanted. 
            <br>1Sa 15:32  "Bring King Agag here to me," Samuel ordered. Agag came to him, trembling with fear, thinking to himself, "What a bitter thing it is to die!" 
            1Sa 15:33  Samuel said, "As your sword has made many mothers childless, so now your mother will become childless." And he cut Agag to pieces in front of the altar in Gilgal. 
            </em></li>
            <li>God’s Spirit helps His beloved children and supports them 1Samuel 7:10 <em>1Sa 7:10  While Samuel was offering the sacrifice, the Philistines moved forward to attack; but just then the LORD thundered from heaven against them. They became completely confused and fled in panic. </em></li>
            <li>Everyone must prepare for the day of accountability and reckoning because it is certain 1Samuel 8:1-5; 12:3 <em>1Sa 8:1  When Samuel grew old, he made his sons judges in Israel. 
            1Sa 8:2  The older son was named Joel and the younger one Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. 
            1Sa 8:3  But they did not follow their father's example; they were interested only in making money, so they accepted bribes and did not decide cases honestly. 
            1Sa 8:4  Then all the leaders of Israel met together, went to Samuel in Ramah, 
            1Sa 8:5  and said to him, "Look, you are getting old and your sons don't follow your example. So then, appoint a king to rule over us, so that we will have a king, as other countries have."<br>
            1Sa 12:3  Here I am. If I have done anything wrong, accuse me now in the presence of the LORD and the king he has chosen. Have I taken anybody's cow or anybody's donkey? Have I cheated or oppressed anyone? Have I accepted a bribe from anyone? If I have done any of these things, I will pay back what I have taken." </em></li>
            <li>He was mentioned in Acts 3:24 and 13:20 by the Apostles as a Seer and a Prophet and numbered in the hall of fame in Hebrews 11:32. <em>Heb 11:32  Should I go on? There isn't enough time for me to speak of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. </em></li>
        </ul>
            <p><b>CLASS ACTIVITY 2: </b>Considering 1Samuel 15:24-25, <em>1Sa 15:24  "Yes, I have sinned," Saul replied. "I disobeyed the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of my men and did what they wanted. 
            1Sa 15:25  But now I beg you, forgive my sin and go back with me, so that I can worship the LORD." </em> was Samuel completely fair in the way he handled Saul’s disobedience even Though the latter acknowledge his sins and asked for pardon?</p>
